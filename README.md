# BigMart-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Kaggle-Challenge
This notebook features a case study on the sales forecast of a supermarket chain. The goal is:

> - Build a predictive model that predicts with some significance the sales of each product at a given point of sale;
> - With this, the intention is to build an analytical report that gives the company's board of relevant insights about the sales of these products in these stores.
